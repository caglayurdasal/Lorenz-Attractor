# Lorenz Attractor Project

This project implements the Lorenz Attractor and numerical methods (Euler's, Heun's, RK4) in Python using Plotly, Matplotlib, and Numpy. It also includes visualizations of the numerical methods on Lorenz Attractor and Poincaré maps.

## Introduction

The Lorenz Attractor is a classical representation of deterministic chaos. This project explores chaotic dynamics through numerical methods, providing visualizations and Poincaré maps for better understanding.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lorenz-attractor.git
   cd lorenz-attractor
   ```

2. Install dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook lorenz_attractor.ipynb
   ```

2. Explore the notebook to understand the Lorenz Attractor and numerical methods.

3. Execute cells to visualize the results.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the required Python libraries installed. You can install them using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run requirements.txt before executing the program:
> pip install -U -r requirements.txt
